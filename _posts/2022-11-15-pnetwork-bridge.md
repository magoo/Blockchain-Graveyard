Bridge misconfiguration resulted in $4.3M stolen. Binance Smart Chain network.

> As it can be seen from BSC explorer, an attacker minted ≈27.8 billions of $GALA tokens twice in Binance Smart Chain (@BNBCHAIN) network
> Then, the attacker started to sell the $GALA tokens via PancakeSwap (@PancakeSwap), dumping the price by more than 99%
> pGALA on BSC Notice: A misconfiguration of the http://p.Network bridge necessitated the redeployment of pGALA. We’re working directly w/the Gala team and w/ exchanges to provide the necessary pGALA balances to restore functionality of pGALA deposits & withdrawals.
> All GALA tokens on Ethereum as well as the underlying bridge collateral are SAFE.
