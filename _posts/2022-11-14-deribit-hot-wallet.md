Hot wallet compromised, accounting to $28M in losses

> Deribit hot wallet compromised, but client funds are safe and loss is covered by company reserves. Our hot wallet was hacked for USD 28m earlier this evening just before midnight UTC on 1 November 2022.
> Client assets, Fireblocks or any of the cold storage addresses are not affected. It's company procedure to keep 99% of our user funds in cold storage to limit the impact of these type of events. The hack is isolated & quarantined to our BTC, ETH and USDC hot wallets.
