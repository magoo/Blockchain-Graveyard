Deployer addresses compromised through profanity attack vector.

> On October 27th, 5:58PM UTC, friesDAO contracts were exploited by an attacker taking control of our own deployer address through a profanity attack vector.
> The hacker was able to drain the treasury of its USDC through the refund contract, drain the FRIES tokens in the staking contract, subsequently selling it all into the Uniswap pool.
