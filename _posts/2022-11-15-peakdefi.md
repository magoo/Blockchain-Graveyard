Insufficent access control. $40k lost in smart contract deployed in Ethereum network.

> @AnciliaInc We detected an attack on ETH contract https://etherscan.io/address/0x07cdb44fa1e7eceb638c12a3451a3dc9ce1400e4, it lost about 32k Matic tokens and hacker gained around ~300k.
> The root cause is that the contract does not have permission check on its sellLeftoverToken() function.
> Seems like the fund belongs to @PEAKDEFI PeakDeFiFund. @PEAKDEFI you might need to check this up.
