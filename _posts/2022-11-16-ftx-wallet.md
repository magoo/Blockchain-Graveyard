FTX wallet compromised. $380M stolen. Insider? Hot vs Cold wallet? TBD

> Multiple former FTX employees confirmed to me they do not recognize these transfers for ~$383m
> Update: $31.4m USDT blacklisted by Tether
> Appears a portion was “whitehat” funds. Would assume this is the 0x97 & 0xd8  address.
> Update: Paxos seems frozen now for 0x59 attacker
