Address used to control rewards compromised through profanity attack vector.

> An attacker exploited our GIVfarm today at about 15:00 UTC.
> This was not a smart contract exploit. Rather, the keys we used to control the rate of rewards to our GIVfarms were compromised.
> The attacker used the compromised keys to change the reward rate for our Mainnet farms to a very large number & then quickly claimed the rewards.
