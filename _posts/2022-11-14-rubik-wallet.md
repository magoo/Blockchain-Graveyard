(Alleged) cold wallet exploit on Rubik's admin wallet resulting in $212k lost.

> Rubicans, One of our adminâ€™s wallet addresses was compromised. This wallet managed the RBC/BRBC bridge and staking rewards. We suspect it was malicious software that was used to get access to the admin wallet's private keys.
> Around 34M of RBC/BRBC were sold on Uniswap and PancakeSwap.
