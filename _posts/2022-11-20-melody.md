Melody offchain signing service compromised. 2225 $BNB tokens lost.

> On October 25, 2022, Melody was hacked due to a vulnerability that allowed the application's token address to be compromised, resulting in the loss of approximately 2225 $BNB tokens.
> The root cause of the attack is that the application's token address was compromised which allowed the hacker to bypass the access control.
> Following the incident, another attacker address repeated the attack, earning 2,450 $SGS and exchanging proceeds for 560 $WBNB.
> The team took the contract to maintenance mode and restarted the withdrawal function after the bug was fixed.
