Price oracle manipulation. $21.8M assets stolen.

> Pando Rings suffered from a hack yesterday on November 5th, 2022. The attacker exploited a vulnerability in Pando Rings price oracle and manipulated the price of sBTC-WBTC (liquidity provider token of the trading pair BTC-WBTC on 4swap) to attempt a theft of approximately $70 million worth of crypto assets.
> $21,877,098.03 worth of crypto assets including ETH, EOS and BTC were unfortunately transferred out from the attacker's two perpetrating Mixin wallets before measures could be taken. Though fortunately, among the transferred funds, Pando team was able to get support and assistance from our community and the transferred 2,022,662.9979 EOS (valuing at approximately $2,362,761.24) has now been frozen.
> And for the larger rest of the hacked funds (approximately at the value of $50 million) that are still in the hacker's wallets, we took as promptly measures as could be done, got assistance from Mixin Network and have had the funds frozen
