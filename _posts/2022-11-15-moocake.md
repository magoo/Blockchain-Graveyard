Insufficent access control via a flash loan. $140k lost. Smart contract in Binance Smart Chain.

> Beosin EagleEye monitored a flashloan attack on MooCakeCTX contract. The loss is ~$140K. There is no time restrictions on collateral and rewards, and the prevention of caller is not comprehensive enough, enabling the attacker to increase dividends via flashloan.
> The attacker executed two more attacks and returned the flashloan with a profit of 424 $BNB (~ $140,000). 
> Suggestion: When developing contracts, pay attention to flashloan attack scenario, the security of the way rewards are issued, and the secure use of library functions.
