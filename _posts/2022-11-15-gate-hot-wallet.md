Unauthorized access to private keys. $234M stolen, allegedly, by North Korea. Gate kept it hidden to the public.

> You talk about the importance of security but how about you finally disclose @gate_io was quietly hacked by NK for $230m on April 21 2018 & how you actively kept this hidden from customers/public
> If you go to the DOJ press release, one of the addresses listed is 0xc49 which is a deposit address for Bittrex. Two hope away from it is an address that received 31,600 ETH on April 21 2018 from the Old @gate_io hot wallet 0x05e.
